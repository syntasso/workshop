### In this tutorial, you will
1. [learn more about Kratix Promises](#promise)
1. [install Jenkins as a Kratix Promise](#install-promise)

# <a name="promise"></a>What is a Kratix Promise?

Conceptually, Promises are the building blocks of Kratix that allow you to develop your platform incrementally. Technically, a Promise is a YAML document that defines a contract between the Platform and its users. We will explore more about this contract and the internals of a Kratix Promise in part 4 where you will [write your own Promise](/writing-a-promise/README.md).

## Kratix Promises

* enable you to build your platform incrementally and in response to the needs of your users.
* codify the contract between platform teams and application teams for the delivery of a specific service, e.g. a database, an identity service, a supply chain, or a complete development pipeline of patterns and tools.
* are easy to build, deploy, and update.
* are sharable and reusable between platforms, teams, business units, and other organisations.
* add up to a frictionless experience when platform users want to create services that they need to deliver value.

Now that you know more about Kratix Promises, follow the steps below to install a Promise.

<br />
<hr>

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
You need a fresh installation of Kratix for this section. The simplest way to do so is by running the quick-start script from within the Kratix directory.

You can run this command from the root of `kratix`:

```bash
./scripts/quick-start.sh --recreate
```

Alternatively, you can go back to [Install Kratix across two KinD clusters](/installing-kratix/).
<br />
<br />

## <a name="install-promise"></a>Install the Kratix sample Jenkins Promise

Now that your system is set up, you can install your first Kratix Promise! You should be in the `kratix` folder.

### Steps
1. [Install the Jenkins Promise](#install-promise)
1. [Request an instance](#request-instance)
1. [Use the instance](#use-instance)
1. [Tear down your environment](#teardown)
<br />
<br />

![Overview](../assets/images/Treasure_Trove-Install_a_Promise.jpg)
<br />
<br />

### <a name="install-promise"></a>Install the Promise

Install Kratix's sample Jenkins Promise.
```bash
kubectl --context kind-platform apply --filename samples/jenkins/jenkins-promise.yaml
```
<br />

Verify that your `platform` cluster has registered Jenkins as a new available Kratix Promise.
```bash
kubectl --context kind-platform get crds jenkins.example.promise.syntasso.io
```

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME                                     CREATED AT
jenkins.example.promise.syntasso.io   2021-05-10T12:00:00Z
```
<br />

Verify that your `worker` cluster has the Jenkins Operator to be able to create Jenkins instances.
```bash
kubectl --context kind-worker --namespace default get pods
```

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jenkins-operator-7886c47f9c-zschr   1/1     Running   0          1m
```
<br />

Congratulations! You have installed your first Kratix Promise, which means your application teams can now get on-demand instances of Jenkins from your platform.

### <a name="request-instance"></a>Request a Jenkins Instance

Application developers using your platform will be issued a Jenkins instance after applying a Kratix Resource Request.
<br />
<br />

![Verify-Instance](../assets/images/Treasure_Trove-Get_an_instance.jpg)
<br />
<br />

Test your platform by acting as an application developer and submitting a Resource Request.
```bash
kubectl --context kind-platform apply --filename samples/jenkins/jenkins-resource-request.yaml
```
<br />

Verify that the Resource Request was issued on the `platform` cluster.
```bash
kubectl --context kind-platform get jenkins.example.promise.syntasso.io
```

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME                AGE
example             1m
```
<br />

Verify the instance was created on the worker cluster<br/>
<sub>(This may take a few minutes so `--watch` will watch the command)</sub>
```bash
kubectl --context kind-worker --namespace default get pods --watch
```

The above command will give an output similar to
```console
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jenkins-example                     1/1     Running   0          1m
jenkins-operator-7886c47f9c-zschr   1/1     Running   0          10m
```
<br />

Congratulations! You have successfully requested and created an on-demand instance of Jenkins from your platform.

### <a name="use-instance"></a>Use your Jenkins instance

Access the Jenkins UI in a browser to ensure the instance is working.
<br />
<br />

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Before you can access Jenkins in the UI, you must port forward from within the Kubernetes cluster to a local port on your computer. Running the `port-forward` command is continuous&mdash;as long as the command is running, the connection stays open.<br />
_**Open a new terminal to request the port forward**_.
```console
kubectl --context kind-worker port-forward jenkins-example 8080:8080
```
<br />

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 and log in with the credentials you get from the commands below.
<br />
<br />

Leave the `port-forward` running in the separate terminal and return to your main terminal.

Copy and paste the Jenkins username into the login page.
```console
kubectl --context kind-worker get secret jenkins-operator-credentials-example -o 'jsonpath={.data.user}' | base64 -d
```
<br />

Copy and paste the Jenkins password into the login page.
```console
kubectl --context kind-worker get secret jenkins-operator-credentials-example -o 'jsonpath={.data.password}' | base64 -d
```
<br />

And verify there is a corresponding Pod on your `worker` cluster by running the following command:
```bash
kubectl --context kind-worker get pods
```

which should result in output similar to
```console
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
jenkins-example                          1/1     Running   0          5m
jenkins-operator-778d6fc487-t5l9x        1/1     Running   0          2m
```
<br />

## Summary

You installed your first Kratix Promise on your platform. Well done!

To recap the steps you took:
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Installed the sample Jenkins Promise
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Requested an instance of Jenkins
1. ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Tested the instance by logging in to the Jenkins UI and checking for pods on your `worker` cluster

This is only the beginning of working with Promises. Next you will deploy three different Promises to provide a complete solution for an application team.

## <a name="teardown"></a>Tearing it all down
The next section in this tutorial requires a clean Kratix installation. Before heading to it, please clean up your environment by running:

```bash
kind delete clusters platform worker
```
<br />


### üéâ &nbsp; Congratulations!
‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp; You have installed a Kratix Promise and used it to create on-demand instances of a service. <br />
üëâüèæ&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you will [deploy a web app that uses multiple Kratix Promises](/using-multiple-promises/README.md).
